# Docker

In this assignment, you will learn the magic of docker, and hopefully
 you'll be able to tell the difference between an image and a
 container in the end.

## Getting started

1. Familiarize yourself with docker. This [tutorial](https://docker-curriculum.com)
 is a good place to start.
2. Install docker on your computer. **NOTE**: If you are on a windows
 machine with endpoint protection this can be a real struggle. Ask a
 friend or a grown-up if you are in doubt or stuck.
3. Build the docker image by running the following command in the
 root directory of this repository 
 `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t fruit_classifier:latest .`
4. Spin up a container for running the [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
 app by running
 `docker run --rm -d -p 5001:5000 fruit_classifier:latest`
5. Open your browser on `localhost:5001` and play around with the app
6. Investigate the image by running
`docker run --rm -it --entrypoint "/bin/bash" fruit_classifier:latest`

## Assignments

The steps in [Getting started](#getting-started) can be time
 consuming enough for most. However, if you are up for some even more
 time consuming challenges you can

1. Register on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com) and push your
 freshly created image
2. Have a look at the 
[flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
 app located in `app/`
3. Play around with `volumes`. Are you able to share 
`generated_data` with the host machine?
